<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Readability" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/2/readability/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I wrote a program that determines the reading grade level of a given text using the Coleman-Liau index. The program calculates the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text and then outputs the corresponding grade level based on the formula.</p> <p>This problem was solved as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input</strong>: The program prompts the user for a block of text.</li> <li><strong>Text Analysis</strong>: It counts the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text.</li> <li><strong>Coleman-Liau Index Calculation</strong>: The program computes the reading grade level using the counts.</li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: The program prints the grade level based on the Coleman-Liau index formula.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Prompt for Text</strong>: The program asks the user to input a piece of text for analysis.</li> <li><strong>Letter, Word, and Sentence Counting</strong>: It uses loops and conditionals to count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the input text.</li> <li><strong>Coleman-Liau Index</strong>: The formula `index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8` is used to calculate the grade level.</li> <li><strong>Print Result</strong>: The program outputs the grade level or a special message if the text is too simple (before Grade 1) or too complex (Grade 16+).</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as standard libraries or the Makefile.</p>
